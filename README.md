## Project Description

This Weather dashboard is a web application that provides users with up-to-date weather information for any city. Users can search for a city and instantly get the current weather conditions, including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather description. The app includes a 5-day forecast, displaying temperature, weather description, humidity, and wind speed for each day. My main motivation behind developing this application was to create a user-friendly weather forecast tool that helps people plan their activities based on accurate weather information. By providing real-time data and a simple interface, users can easily access weather updates for any desired location. Throughout this project I gained experience using third-party APi's to fetch weather data and manipulate it to display the relevant information. This project allowed me to strengthen my JavaScript skills, particularly in working with APIs, handling data, and dynamically updating the user interface.

## Features

1. Search for a city: Users can enter the name of any city to get the weather forecast.

2. Current weather conditions: The app displays the current temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather description for the searched city.

3. Weather icon: An icon representing the current weather condition is displayed to provide visual context.

4. 5-day forecast: Users can view the weather forecast for the next 5 days, including temperature, weather description, humidity, and wind speed.

5. Search history: The app keeps a record of previously searched cities for quick access and reference.

6. Dynamic background: The background image changes based on the current weather condition, enhancing the visual experience.
